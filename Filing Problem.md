# Filing Problem
Level: Easy

Description:
```

```

## Writeup
You are given a broken file `memo`. Upon running a cat analysis, you can see the remnants of a broken pdf file. Assuming that the flag would display as part of the text of the pdf, you can do a pdftotext command which outputs `memo.txt` which contains the flag above the closing salutation.

**Flag** - `C1{c0rrup7ion_4nd_r3dac7tion}`
